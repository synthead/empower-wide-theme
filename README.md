# Wide theme for Empower Personal Dashboard

Here's a theme for Empower Personal Dashboard that removes the narrow width constraint for the content!  This allows all the graphs, tables, and other useful content take full size of your browser.

## How to use

1. Install the Stylus add-on for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
1. Click [here](https://github.com/synthead/empower-wide-theme/raw/main/empower-wide-theme.user.css), then click the "Install style" button.
1. You're done!
